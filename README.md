# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Instructor

[Reto WÃ¼est](http://retowuest.net/) (University of Geneva)

## Course Description

With ever more data available in electronic form, automated methods of data analysis become increasingly important also in the social sciences. Machine learning refers to a set of methods that can automatically detect patterns in data, or "learn" from data. The uncovered patterns can then be used by the analyst to make accurate predictions and decisions under uncertainty.

This course will introduce participants to the fundamentals of machine learning. Students will leave the course with a thorough understanding of the core issues in machine learning (prediction and inference, supervised and unsupervised learning, overfitting, bias-variance trade-off), knowledge of some of the most widely used machine learning methods, and the ability to apply these methods in their own research. All course materials are available at <http://retowuest.net/ml2018/>.

## Software

The course will use the open-source software R, which is freely available for download at <https://www.r-project.org/>. We will interact with R through the user interface RStudio, which can be downloaded at <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>.

## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a solid understanding of linear and binary regression models. The course will also assume at least a basic familiarity with the R statistical programming language.
